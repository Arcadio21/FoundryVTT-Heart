Your GM will provide you with class/callings which you can drag & drop onto your sheet.</p><p><b>GMs:</b> the 'Prepare Rollout Request' macro will help your players make rolls more easily. You'll need to create classes and callings for your players by hand, but it should be more or less intuitive how to do this.</p><h2>New In This Version</h2><ul><li>Added a new translation: Espa√±ol! Thanks go to jesberpen for providing the translation! </ul><h2>Recently Changed</h2><ul><li>Fixed text-based descriptions on character sheets</li><li>Fixed code that broke some chat hooks (e.g. Theatre Inserts).</li><li>Bug fixing missing output from rollable tables</li><li>New item type: Tag!</li><li>Resources and Equipment can contain Tags, adjustable in their sheet views. Tags will also show up in the brackets section of their previews.</li><li>Added a section to show inactive items that the actor directly and made dragged items active by default</li><li>Fixes to allow dragging items onto classes & callings</li><li>New Startup Message (you're reading it)</li><li>Module Setting to hide old text boxes in character sheets </li><li>Added 'Class' Item type for character sheets</li><li>Abilities, Beats, Resources and Equipment inherited from classes and callings show up on the character sheet (toggle with <span class='fas fa-fas fa-toggle-on'></span>).
