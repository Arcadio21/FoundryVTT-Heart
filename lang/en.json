Now, desperate people, fringe historians and heretic cults hide in the infrastructure, using the strange unreality within to further their own ends.</p> <p>Using barely-understood technology and living in the space between worlds, the Vermissian Knights do their level best to understand the parasite reality and protect others they find there. They are in high demand as companions on delves: they have an understanding of the Heart, a good sword arm and a suit of powered armour built from scavenged train materials that helps keep them (and their allies) alive.</p> <p>Knights will inscribe the names of landmarks that they have discovered, or found stable routes to, on their armour - it is as much a research project and an advertisement of their prowess as it is a means of protection. Each knight's suit is utterly unique, using technology taken from a dozen different places: different gauges of steels, different weights and levels of protection and flexibility and controls that are often inscrutable to anyone but the creator themselves</p>",

Your GM will provide you with class/callings which you can drag & drop onto your sheet.</p><p><b>GMs:</b> the 'Prepare Rollout Request' macro will help your players make rolls more easily. You'll need to create classes and callings for your players by hand, but it should be more or less intuitive how to do this.</p><h2>New In This Version</h2><ul><li>Compendia! There are now compendia for Fallouts, Tags, Callings and some of the Classes.</li></ul><h2>Recently Changed</h2><ul><li>Added a new translation: Español! Thanks go to jesberpen for providing the translation!<li>Fixed text-based descriptions on character sheets</li><li>Fixed code that broke some chat hooks (e.g. Theatre Inserts).</li><li>Bug fixing missing output from rollable tables</li><li>New item type: Tag!</li><li>Resources and Equipment can contain Tags, adjustable in their sheet views. Tags will also show up in the brackets section of their previews.</li><li>Added a section to show inactive items that the actor directly and made dragged items active by default</li><li>Fixes to allow dragging items onto classes & callings</li><li>New Startup Message (you're reading it)</li><li>Module Setting to hide old text boxes in character sheets </li><li>Added 'Class' Item type for character sheets</li><li>Abilities, Beats, Resources and Equipment inherited from classes and callings show up on the character sheet (toggle with <span class='fas fa-fas fa-toggle-on'></span>).
