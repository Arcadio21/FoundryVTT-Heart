# Heart - The City Beneath

This is a simplistic FoundryVTT implementation of [Heart - The City Beneath](https://rowanrookanddecard.com/product/heart-the-city-beneath-rpg/). It provides a character sheet based on the provided inside Heart. It doesn't currently do anything fancier than storing numbers and textfields.
## Features

* Saves your character information as text - wow
* Multiline inputs use FoundryVTT's inbuilt rich text editor
* Skills can be checked, as expected
* Resistances and Protections can be increased and decreased by clicking on the boxes.

## TODO

[X] Make a basic fillable character sheet.
[ ] Get a hold of the fonts, or something like them (main one is "The Bartender Condensed Serif Press" by Vintage Voyage Design Supply)
[ ] Convert Equipment, Resources, Abilities and Fallout from a textfield to a list of textfields
[ ] Make Equipment & Resources Rollable
[ ] Add a roller that lets you pick skill, domain, knacks & mastery, difficulty etc
[ ] Add a stress roller
[ ] Look into adding "class" and "calling" items
