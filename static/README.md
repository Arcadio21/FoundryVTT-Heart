# Heart - The City Beneath

This is a simplistic implementation of [Heart - The City Beneath](https://rowanrookanddecard.com/product/heart-the-city-beneath-rpg/) for [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) . It provides a character sheet based on the one provided inside Heart. It doesn't currently do anything fancier than storing numbers and textfields.
## Features

* Saves your character information as text - wow
* Multiline inputs use FoundryVTT's inbuilt rich text editor
* Skills can be checked, as expected
* Resistances and Protections can be increased and decreased by clicking on the boxes.
* Rollable buttons (and macros for the GM) in character sheets for rolling, stress and fallout.
* Clickable chat messages to perform rolls.

## Usage

New buttons are available in the character sheet for players, or from the hotbar via macros for the GM.

### Roll Requests

A roll request is a clickable chat message that allows the players to roll with specific parameters. Rolls can be made via: 
* "Request Roll" button in a Character Sheet
* "Prepare Roll Request" Macro

Clicking on either of these will open a window like below:

For example, preparing a roll request like this:

will create a chat message like this:

### Rolls

This is a typical "Heart" `1d10` roll. Rolls can be made with the following: 
* "Roll" button in a Character sheet
* "Roll" button in chat message
* "Prepare Roll" Macro

As before, this will open a new window. Depending on the source, we might not need to fill in the difficulty setting. From the macro, we see:

But from the chat message, we have:

Again, this might result in chat messages like:

![Failure roll](https://i.imgur.com/dwtGFPA.png)

### Stress

We also can manage stress rolls.

Stress rolls can be made with the following: 
* "Roll Stress" button in a Character sheet
* "Roll Stress" button in chat message
* "Prepare Stress Roll" Macro

From the macro:

![Prepare stress roll](https://i.imgur.com/0NzCkBf.png)

which might result in:

![Stress chat message](https://i.imgur.com/ZZ1rZhJ.png)

### Fallout

We also can manage fallout rolls. Stress rolls can be made with the following: 
* "Roll Fallout" button in a Character sheet
* "Prepare Fallout Roll" Macro

An example chat message as a result:

## Translations

If you're considering writing a translation, firstly: thank you! You can provide translation files in two ways:

## Method 1: Send me a single lang/{lang}.json file

Find [lang/en.json](https://github.com/hitcherland/FoundryVTT-Heart/blob/release/lang/en.json) and translate it, then send the file to me.

This method is easier for you, but requires me to do some work to adjust it to the format I use for the [development branch](https://github.com/hitcherland/FoundryVTT-Heart/tree/development) that I use to actually build the system. This means it is subject to me getting around to it, which has previously taken a few months.

## Method 2: Submit A Pull Request to the Development Branch

You can find the development branch [here](https://github.com/hitcherland/FoundryVTT-Heart/tree/development). As mentioned above, this is the branch that actually builds the "release" branch. Fork the repo, and modify the duplicate the many instances of the `lang/en.json` file. You can find these by searching for `en.json`, (e.g. in Github, by going to [Find a File](https://github.com/hitcherland/FoundryVTT-Heart/find/development) and typing `en.json`).

This is easier for me (and quicker for you), as I can just accept it directly.

## Contributing
It is not recommended to develop on the instance on Foundry you run games from. If you need help installing another version of foundry or a dev environment this isn't the guide for that.

To test your changes:

Add your Foundry installation's Data location to `foundryvtt.config.js` it should look something like:
`foundryvttPath: "/home/yourusername/foundryuserdata/Data"` 

Inside this directory run:
```shell
npm ci
npm run build .
```

If everything is setup correctly this will create a symlink from this directory's `dist` folder to your foundry systems folder. It will then build this project and the built version will appear in `dist`. With the symlink in place you can then open Foundry and interact with the system as normal.
